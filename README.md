# Bike Sharing Company Analysis for Market Strategy

## Background and overview

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike sharing offer. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bikes that are geolocated and locked at a network of 692 stations in Chicago. 
Bikes can be unlocked at one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.

Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy has been based on generating general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, day passes and single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or all-day passes are referred to as **casuals**. Customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as **members**.

Cyclistic's financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. While flexible pricing helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the marketing director believes that maximizing annual memberships will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets new customers, she believes there is a very good opportunity to convert casual users into members. She points out that casual users are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

This project analyzes Cyclistic's historical cycling trip data to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual cyclists into annual members.

The data set used is from a real company called [Divvy](https://divvybikes.com/). Here are the [data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data).

Findings and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:

- Temporal comparative analysis: analyzes and discovers patterns at different temporal granularities.

- Behavioral analysis: Analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic users.
